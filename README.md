## User Story

As a person who wants to GitFit, I want an application where I can search a variety of exercises and workouts so That I can save them and create my own customized workout plan.

## Description

Upon loading the application I am presented with a Toggle option to sign-in to my account or sign-up for a new account. My credentials are saved to localstorage, I am assigned a JW token, and I am given my own user account. Then I am logged into my account and able to perform my search for exercises. I am given a navigation bar where I can add a new workout or logout. When I search by keyword I am given matching exercise suggestions for that keyword and I can select unlimited amount of workouts to save to my profile and local storage. When I save a workout then I will see them displayed one by one under my saved workouts. I am able to update and delete a workout from my saved workouts and my page will update with the workout removed. When I click logout then I am redirected back to the initial login or signup page.
